# Queue / backlog

Pending work, roughly prioritized. Reflects decisions on 2026-07-05.

## Next up (source bugs — hurt daily use)
- [x] **aquamanga** (`626267…`) — was NOT broken search: site 404s on `/page/2` past the last results page; our infinite-scroll looped on it. Fixed by stopping pagination on a next-page error (5eacd6e).
- [ ] **mangadot** (`5900…`) — per user, the installed **extension is outdated**; a newer version likely fixes the CF handling. Action: update/replace the mangadot extension (repo), no app-code change. (Our interceptor already fails clearly if it still can't clear — 9512846.)
- [x] **mangafire** (`6084…`) — search timed out at 20s. Root cause: it computes an anti-bot `vrf` token via a WebView `evaluateJavascript`, but our provider DROPPED null/undefined results (and JS errors went down a cancel path), so the callback never fired and the extension's latch hit its own 20s timeout. Fixed: always invoke the callback ("null" on null, JSON-encoded to match Android) + JS errors now deliver null through the normal query path. Pending on-device test.

## Nice-to-have (UI polish)
- [x] First-run WebView UX: friendly "Starting in-app browser…" panel + auto-retry (createClient also waits up to 30s for CEF). (f7d7f32)
- [x] Cosmetic rename `Kcef*` → `Jcef*` now on JetBrains JCEF (8471593).

## Won't do (per user)
- FlareSolverr concurrency throttle + session-TTL tuning — user says FlareSolverr is fine. Skip.
- Trackers + library management — user doesn't care. Dropped from scope for now.

## Proxmox deploy (not yet — but the destination)
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml`: `:server` + `flaresolverr` siblings, container-to-container networking, per-container `mem_limit`, `shm_size: 1g` for both Chromiums.
- [ ] `:server` Dockerfile with headless-CEF deps (fontconfig, libX11/libnss, etc.) so JCEF's Chromium subprocesses run in-container.
- [ ] Note: on native Docker/Proxmox the `vmmemWSL` reservation quirk disappears — memory tracks real working set. `.wslconfig` is Windows-dev only (`autoMemoryReclaim=gradual` if you want it tamed locally).

## Done recently
- [x] **URLs / deep-linking** — Search now URL-driven (6f8d887); Detail/Reader/SPA-fallback already were. User: URL length is fine as-is, just keep links robust.
- [x] **Source-not-installed card** on Detail for links to a missing extension (3cae183).
- [x] **FlareSolverr cold-start retry** (smooths comix's flaky first solve) + **friendly port-in-use message** (3cae183).

## Feature backlog (fuller list — pick by impact)
### Reader experience
- [ ] Tap-zone navigation (tap edges to page / jump), and an end-of-chapter "next chapter" overlay.
- [ ] Reader background/theme (black / white / sepia) + brightness dim overlay.
- [ ] Per-source sizing memory (some sources are webtoon, some paged); double-page spread option.
- [ ] Pinch-zoom / double-tap zoom on a page.
### Library
- [ ] Categories / collections + sort & filter (unread, recently updated, title, source).
- [ ] Unread-count badges; bulk actions (mark read, download, remove).
- [ ] Library search box.
### Discovery
- [ ] Per-source genre/filter UI in browse (sort, tags).
- [ ] "Updates" feed — new chapters across your whole library in one list.
### Downloads / offline
- [ ] Download a range / whole manga; storage-usage view; per-manga "keep downloaded".
- [ ] Verify offline reading of downloaded chapters end-to-end in the web reader.
### Links / sharing
- [ ] External paste-a-source-URL → resolve to source + open (inbound, the "(b)" feature).
- [ ] Prettier slug-in-path URLs (deferred — user OK with current length).
### Deploy / infra
- [ ] **Proxmox**: docker-compose (:server + flaresolverr, mem_limit, shm_size) + :server Dockerfile with headless-CEF deps.
- [ ] Throttle the every-2s /api/sources poll.
- [ ] **USB backup system** (Docker): the container auto-mounts a USB drive holding data/backups, writes to it, then unmounts. Small addition to the deploy/ Docker setup. **Waiting on a spec .md from the user with the exact behavior** (mount point, what/when to back up, mount+unmount lifecycle, safety). Do not build until that arrives.

## Done recently
- [x] **Global search** — per-source rows + toggleable "Has results" filter; a failed source counts as no-results (6d19bca).
- [~] Reader polish: preload slider for hybrid, "Keep screen on" (Wake Lock), resume re-pin on resize/rotate (f7d7f32). Remaining ideas: per-source sizing memory, tap-zone nav, brightness.

## Explicitly NOT now
- Desktop (Compose) UI backlog — paused; focus is the web UI.
